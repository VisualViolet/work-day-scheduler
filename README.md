# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

A workday scheduler that allows a user to create and save events in specified timeblocks. This challenge allowed me to use skills learned in the UW Coding Bootcamp such as JavaScript, jQuery, and the DayJS library. The end product is a user friendly scheduling application that automatically updates to the current date and time as well as saves time block events persistently until they are removed. In building this application, I have learned how to use JavaScript libraries to enhance applications and provide a better end user experience.

## Installation

No installation necessary. Simply view the link to my deployed application here: https://visualviolet.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

## Usage

This scheduler can be used to plan out a basic 9AM - 5PM workday. The current date will be displayed at the top and each timeblock is color coded to show the user at a glance which timeblock they are currently in, what has passed, and what is upcoming. Users can write events in these timeblocks and click the save button to commit the event to local storage. This will remain on the page even if it is refreshed. To empty, please clear the text from the timeblock and click "Save". Students and new developers may view the commented code to gain an understanding of how I have used JavaScript and its libraries to create this application. Local storage can be viewed in Chrome DevTools by clicking "Application" and viewing the content under the "local storage" tab.
